# book-catalog

## Project
My client is an avid reader that spends her time searching for the next book on her list.
She wants an application that would help her keep track of her next read, so that she
can buy now or save for later.

My clients requests are as follow:

  * When the application is opened, a feature to sign up, log in, 
  and search for books is displayed
  
  * Search results will feature a bookâ€™s title, author, description,
  image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
  
  * When logged in, the user is able to save/remove results and view 
  their saved searches
  
  * Signing up will require: valid email address, username, and password
  * Logging in will require: email address and password
  * Logging out will return the page back to
